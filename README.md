# H261VideoCompression

A winforms application that implements the compression aspects of H261 Video Compression. The application allows the user to open up 2 frames or images and then compresses the images using JPEG compression and motion-compensated inter-picture prediction. Depending on the selected reference area for the macroblock predictions as well as the quantization matrix used, I was able to achieve compression ratios of up to 12 times the original size.
